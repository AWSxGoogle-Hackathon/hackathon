Working on backend, setup and activate virtual env to ensure you can run stuff. 

```
pip install virtualenv
```

```
virtualenv venv
```

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After setting up for the first time, just use source activate and install requirements.
